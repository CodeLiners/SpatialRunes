A Not-So-Humble Beginning
======

Many people have asked this, and yes, I will be continuing this after ModJam. It will get tons of new runes, Containers that actually work right, and more. I guess you can consider this "1.0" a Beta or even Aphla, as the best is yet to come.

Today's Rollercoaster:

jameslfc19: Since TheMike has been at school for the last day of ModJam it's been down to me and max96at to fix any small bugs left (and even finish some features) I'm no way as competent at Java and MinecraftForge Modding as TheMike. I and max96at have both been doing Textures for the Spatial Runes mod. 

I started today learning how to use Git correctly (Thanks to max96at for teaching me :)) I'd watched the mod being built from the ground up since Thursday Night and was familiar with how the mod was working, I've only really had experience with Web code such as HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript. And lua for ComputerCraft ;) I knew TheMike had worked so hard on this mod over the past few days, And I didn't want the mod to be released with a few bugs. So I opened eclipse, and started looking at what needed to be done. And hey! Within half an hour I had added a new Rune! And then I added some more. I then fixed a GUI bug and changed the Carving Table Model, and added a feature to the wands. I'm happy at the stage the mod is now at :) No doubt TheMike has a TON more features to be added, his ideas are always great :)

ModJam has taught me loads, and I think I can speak for TheMike and max96at as well.

Thanks!
