##Spatial Runes
======
Originally for ModJam, this mod adds tons of exciting runes to Minecraft.

Many people have asked this, and yes, I will be continuing this after ModJam. It will get tons of new runes, Containers that actually work right, and more. I guess you can consider this "1.0" a Beta or even Alpha, as the best is yet to come.

Requires MCore, found at https://github.com/TrainerGuy22/MCore/

Thanks!
